# pitch-perception

Pitch Perception allows you to see the audio features of your playlists in a beautiful and neat way. 
Choose a playlist to see its average audio features and a specific
audio feature to see the flow of all your songs in the playlist.
Find out if you like your newest Spotify mixes without actually hearing them. 

I use the Spotify API for fetching playlists and audio features.
Tools used: Spotify Web API, Vue
